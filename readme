Had to run the following from the asadmin to get the JMS working:

asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory --description "connection factory for new factory" jms/NewMessageFactory
Connector resource jms/NewMessageFactory created.
Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.
asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.Queue --property Name=PhysicalDestination jms/NewMessage
Administered object jms/NewMessage created.
Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.
